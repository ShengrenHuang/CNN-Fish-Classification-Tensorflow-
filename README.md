# CNN-Fish-Classification-Tensorflow-

In this practice, we adopt Tensorflow (python package) to implement a fish classification algorithm using a convolutional neural network (by referring to [1]). The CNN architecture in our code has two convolutional, two max-pooling, and a fully-connected layer with Relu activation functions. The type of training error we adopted here is binary_crossentropy loss. The result shows that the performance is well.
